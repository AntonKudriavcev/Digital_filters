Band_stop_(3 in 1) use Matlab simulation filter(High pass, + 2 bandstop) and show waveform and spectrum before and after filration

Band_stop_(All-permeable) use filter based on All-permeable and show wave form and spectrum before and after filration

Band_stop_(All-permeable_Double filtering) use filter based on All-permeable and filter .wav file from WAV folder.
